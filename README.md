# Digital Image Processing (COL 783) Assignments

Assignments completed while pursuing the course on image processing and analysis.

## Assignments

0.  ***Basic Image Access*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a0.html)
    - The goal of this assignment is to ensure that we are able to read, write, and edit images.
1.  ***Tone Mapping HDR Images*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a1.html)
    - Working with and processing HDR ( _High Dynamic Range_ ) images, to analyse intensitiy domains and image features.
    - Implementing various *Tone-Mapping* algorithms, comparing and arguing their tradeoffs.
    - Assignment [report](./1/report.pdf)
2.  ***Denoising and Deblurring*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a2.html)
    - Working with the idea of image delurring and denoising.
    - Implmenting various (basic) algorithms, helping with the problems associated.
    - Working on modern adaptive and edge preserving denoising models. (TV denoising)
    - Extending the principles to help with edge preserving deblurring, giving nice results.
    - Assignment [report](./2/report_bonus.pdf)
3. ***Pyramids and Wavelets*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a3.html)
    - Explored the use of image pyramids and wavelet transforms for various applications including seamless blending, edge-preserving denoising, and image compression.
    - Implemented various time-frequency preserving transformations (Laplacian Pyramids, Haar Transform, Lazy-Wavelet Transform).
    - Used these to come up with efficient compression techniques using bit level optimization (Huffmann Encoding, Run-Length Encoding).
4. ***Robust Forms Processing*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a4.html)
    - Worked on processing photos and scans of printed form in order to extract the form fields and the written information entered in them.
    - Used various routines for data extraction including, edge detection, keypoint detection, thresholding and other segmentation techniques, morphological operations, etc.
    - Designed an automated sequence of operations to apply for each task, and choose the best parameters for each, to get as accurate results as possible.
    - Assignment [report](./4/report.pdf)
5. ***Texture Synthesis*** <br>
    [More](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~narain/courses/col783i1920/a5.html)
    - Implemented various texture synthesis algorithms and demosntrated their use-cases and feasability.
